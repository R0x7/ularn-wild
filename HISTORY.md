# History and copyright

This app is an Android port of Julian Olds' Ularn 1.6.3a, made from the
unmodified upstream C source kept in
[R0x7/ularn-1.6.3a](https://github.com/R0x7/ularn-1.6.3a). The game itself
is the work of the people below; this repository adds the Android front end
and app around it.

## Where the game comes from

This history follows Derek Newhall's
[The History of Larn and Ularn](https://larn.org/history/history) on larn.org.
Only the line that leads to this code is given here. See that page for the
whole family tree, the other ports and the Larn-likes, and for what is still
unknown. Corrections are welcome there.

### Larn

## Copyright

**This repository does not claim copyright in Larn or Ularn.** The game
belongs to its authors: Noah Morgan (Larn), Phil Cordier (Ularn), David
Richerby, Josh Brandt and Josh Bressers (Ularn 1.5), Julian Olds (Ularn 1.6)
and the others named above. Only the new work in this repository (its own
code, tools and documentation) is by the repository's contributors.

**The license is not clear-cut.** Larn 12.0 was released by Noah Morgan with
permission to use, change and port the sources, on the condition that no one
makes a profit from Larn, its sources or that work without his permission.
As larn.org explains, every version that comes from Larn's code, Ularn
included, is still bound by that condition. Julian Olds released Ularn 1.6
under the GNU GPL (see `app/src/main/cpp/ularn/COPYRIGHT`), but larn.org notes that the
Free Software Foundation does not accept a no-profit condition as compatible
with the GPL, so the GPL notice may not be enough on its own.

So this project is shared **for free and non-commercially only**, in keeping
with Noah Morgan's terms. Do not sell it or make money from it. The GPL text
is included because the 1.6 sources carry it, not as a claim that the whole
game is free software. This note is not legal advice. If you are the holder
of any of these rights and want something changed or removed, please open an
issue.
